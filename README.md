- Picked up this book to help cement prior go knowledge and hopefully learn something new. This repo is to keep track of the project we're building through out the book! ðŸ“š

- Book has been completed! It was a great read and highly recommened it and it coveres a lot of concepts and shows how to build a project with a frontend using strictly go which helped bring a better understanding of the language and it's capabilities. Other topics were covered such as testing, mocks, security (TLS, XSS, CSRF).

- Excited to start the next book in the series [Let's Go Further](https://lets-go-further.alexedwards.net/)
